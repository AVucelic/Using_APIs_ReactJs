# Using APIs with ReactJS

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to use APIs with ReactJS to build a dynamic and interactive web application. It showcases how to fetch data from various APIs and display it using React components.

## Features

- Fetch and display data from public APIs
- Utilize React hooks for managing state and side effects
- Responsive and user-friendly interface
- Error handling and loading states

## Technologies Used

- **ReactJS**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Axios**: Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
- **React Hooks**: For managing state and side effects.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can download them from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AVucelic/Using_APIs_ReactJs.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd Using_APIs_ReactJs
    ```

3. **Install the dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    This will start the application and open it in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

The project demonstrates various examples of using APIs in ReactJS. Once the development server is running, you can explore different components that fetch data from APIs and display it.

- **Home**: A landing page with an overview of the application.
- **API Examples**: Various examples of API calls and data display.
